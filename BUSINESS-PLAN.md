# SeekAlpha — 6-Month Business Plan
### Decentralized Prediction Markets on Solana
*February 2026 — August 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

**SeekAlpha** is a decentralized prediction market platform built on the Solana blockchain, designed for the upcoming Solana Seeker smartphone and its dApp Store. Users bet YES or NO on real-world outcomes — crypto prices, sports, politics, AI, and more — with all settlements handled transparently on-chain.

**The Opportunity:**
- Prediction markets are a $50B+ industry growing rapidly (Polymarket did $9B in volume in 2025)
- There is NO prediction market on Solana Mobile / Seeker dApp Store
- Solana Seeker has 150K+ pre-orders — a built-in audience of crypto-native users
- The $SKR Season 2 builder airdrop rewards early dApp builders

**Our Edge:**
- First mover on Solana Seeker dApp Store
- 3% fee (vs Kalshi 10%, Polymarket ~5% effective)
- No KYC, no geo-restrictions — global access
- Fully on-chain, open source — verifiable trust
- Mobile-first design
- AI-powered development (2 engineers worth of output from 1 person + AI)

**What We're Asking:** $6,000–12,000 seed investment for audit, AI development, mainnet launch, and 6 months of operations.

**Projected ROI:** Break-even at ~$5K daily volume. At $50K daily volume (0.1% of Polymarket), the platform generates ~$1,500/day in fees ($45K/month).

## Financial Plan

### Startup Costs (One-Time)

| Item | Cost | When |
|------|------|------|
| Domain (seekalpha.bet) | $15 | ✅ Done |
| VPS (Hostinger) | $15/mo | ✅ Running |
| LLC Registration (Wyoming) | $100-200 | Month 1 |
| Smart Contract Audit | $1,500-3,000 | Month 2-3 |
| Legal (ToS review) | $300-500 | Month 2 |
| Trademark filing | $250-350 | Month 6 |
| **Total one-time** | **$2,200-4,100** | |

### Monthly Operating Costs

| Item | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| VPS hosting | $15 | Current Hostinger plan |
| Vercel (frontend) | $0 | Free tier sufficient |
| Domain renewal | ~$1.25 | Annual paid |
| OpenClaw (AI dev) | Already running | Chito's existing setup |
| AI Development (2 Opus bots) | $600-1,200/mo | Two parallel AI devs — full engineering team |
| Moderator | $0-200 | Depending on arrangement |
| Solana RPC (mainnet) | $0-50 | Free tier → Helius/Triton |
| **Total monthly** | **$615-1,415** | |

### Revenue Projections

Based on 3% fee on winning payouts:

| Monthly Volume | Fee Revenue | Net Profit (minus costs) |
|----------------|------------|-------------------------|
| $5,000 | $150 | ~Break even |
| $10,000 | $300 | $0-100 |
| $50,000 | $1,500 | $1,100-1,400 |
| $100,000 | $3,000 | $2,600-2,900 |
| $500,000 | $15,000 | $14,600-14,900 |

**Break-even point (ops only):** ~$20,000-45,000/month in volume ($600-1,400/day)
This covers monthly operating costs including AI development. Achievable with ~200 active users betting ~$5/day.

**Break-even point (total investment recovery):** At $50K monthly volume, the full $10K investment is recovered within ~7-8 months of mainnet launch.

### Funding Request: $6,000-12,000

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Smart contract audit | $1,500-3,000 | Security verification before mainnet |
| LLC + Legal | $400-700 | Business entity + Terms of Service |
| Treasury SOL | $500-1,000 | Mainnet operations + seed liquidity |
| AI Development (2 bots, 6 months) | $3,600-7,200 | Two Opus-class AI developers running in parallel — equivalent of a full engineering team |
| Marketing budget | $200-500 | First KOL partnerships + contests |
| Buffer | $200-500 | Unexpected costs |
| **Total** | **$6,400-12,900** | |

> **Note on AI Development Costs:** Our entire engineering team runs on two AI developer instances at ~$300-600/month each ($600-1,200/mo total). A traditional startup would spend $15,000-30,000/month on two senior developers for the same output. **We operate at ~4% of traditional engineering costs.** This is our unfair advantage.

### Return on Investment

**Conservative scenario** (reaching $50K monthly volume by Month 6):
- Monthly revenue: $1,500
- Annual projected: $18,000
- ROI on $10K investment: **80% in year 1**

**Moderate scenario** (reaching $100K monthly volume by Month 6):
- Monthly revenue: $3,000
- Annual projected: $36,000
- ROI on $10K investment: **260% in year 1**

**Bull scenario** (reaching $500K monthly volume — small fraction of Polymarket):
- Monthly revenue: $15,000
- Annual projected: $180,000
- ROI on $10K investment: **1,700% in year 1**

*Note: As revenue grows, AI costs stay flat — margins improve dramatically at scale.*

## Competitive Landscape

| Feature | SeekAlpha | Polymarket | Kalshi | Azuro |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------|-------|
| Blockchain | Solana | Ethereum/Polygon | Centralized | Multi-chain |
| Fees | 3% | ~5% effective | 5-10% | 3-10% |
| KYC Required | No | No (but limited) | Yes | No |
| Geo-restrictions | None | Many countries blocked | US only | Limited |
| Mobile app | Seeker dApp Store | Web only | iOS/Android | Web only |
| Open source | Yes | Partial | No | Yes |
| Speed | <1 second (Solana) | ~15 seconds | Instant (centralized) | Varies |
| TX cost | <$0.01 | $0.05-5.00 | $0 (centralized) | Varies |

**Why we win:** SOL-native, mobile-first, lowest fees, no barriers to entry, and first mover on the fastest-growing mobile crypto platform (Seeker).

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Smart contract vulnerability | Medium | Critical | Professional audit, bug bounty, max bet caps |
| Regulatory action | Low-Medium | High | LLC structure, no US-specific marketing, decentralized design |
| Low user adoption | Medium | High | First-mover on Seeker, aggressive community building |
| Solana network issues | Low | Medium | Graceful error handling, retry logic |
| Competition enters Seeker | Medium | Medium | Build fast, establish brand, community moat |
| Seeker phone delays | Low | Low-Medium | Web app works on any device, not Seeker-dependent |

## Team

**Heronimo_V (Founder & CEO)**
- Vision, strategy, business development
- Community leadership and partnerships
- Brand and marketing direction

**Kip Klaw (AI Lead Developer)**
- Full-stack development (Rust smart contracts, Next.js frontend)
- Architecture and technical decisions
- 24/7 development capability — equivalent output of 2-3 full-time developers
- Operational cost: fraction of a single developer salary

**Future Hires (as revenue allows):**
- Community Manager (Month 4-5)
- Second AI developer instance for parallel development
- Part-time designer for marketing assets

---

## Why This Works

1. **Timing is everything.** Seeker launches soon with 150K+ pre-orders and a fresh dApp Store. Being first = free distribution to every Seeker user.

2. **Prediction markets are proven.** Polymarket did $9B+ in volume in 2025. The demand exists — we're bringing it to Solana Mobile.

3. **AI-powered development.** We build at 10x the speed of a traditional startup. What takes a funded team 6 months, we ship in weeks.

4. **Low overhead.** No office, no salaries, minimal infrastructure costs. Almost every dollar of revenue is profit.

5. **The airdrop opportunity.** $SKR Season 2 rewards builders. Being in the dApp Store early could mean significant token allocation — potentially worth more than the entire investment.

6. **Revenue from day one.** 3% fee means we earn from the first bet placed on mainnet. No need to figure out monetization later.

*"The best time to build on Solana was 2021. The second best time is right now — before 150,000 Seeker phones ship with an empty dApp Store waiting for us."*
