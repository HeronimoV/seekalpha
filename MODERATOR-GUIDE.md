## 🔮 What is SeekAlpha?

SeekAlpha is a **decentralized prediction market** built on the Solana blockchain. Users bet YES or NO on real-world outcomes — crypto prices, sports, politics, AI, pop culture — and earn payouts when they're right.

**Think of it like:** Polymarket, but on Solana — faster, cheaper, no KYC, mobile-first.

### Why SeekAlpha Exists
- **Polymarket** runs on Ethereum (expensive, slow bridging)
- **Kalshi** requires KYC, charges 10% fees, US-restricted
- **SeekAlpha** is SOL-native, 3% fee, no KYC, no geo-restrictions, fully on-chain, open source

We're building specifically for the **Solana Seeker phone** and its dApp Store.

## ❓ FAQ — Common Questions & Answers

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I use SeekAlpha?**
A: Go to seekalpha.bet → connect your Phantom wallet → browse markets → pick YES or NO → enter your bet amount → sign the transaction. That's it!

**Q: What wallet do I need?**
A: Phantom wallet. Available as a browser extension or mobile app. Download at phantom.app.

**Q: Is it free to try?**
A: Yes! We're on Solana devnet right now, so you're using free test SOL. No real money needed.

**Q: How do I get devnet SOL?**
A: Go to faucet.solana.com, paste your wallet address, and request an airdrop. You'll get free devnet SOL to play with.

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**
A: No account needed. Just connect your Solana wallet. Your wallet IS your account.

### How It Works

**Q: How does betting work?**
A: Pick a market → choose YES or NO → enter your bet amount → sign with your wallet. When the market resolves, if you were right, you can claim your winnings (minus 3% fee). Your payout depends on the ratio of the YES/NO pools.

**Q: What's the fee?**
A: 3% on winnings only. If you lose, you pay nothing extra. This is one of the lowest fees in prediction markets (Kalshi charges ~10%).

**Q: Who resolves markets?**
A: Currently the admin team resolves markets based on verified real-world outcomes. Oracle integration (automated resolution) is planned for a future update.

**Q: Can I bet on the same market twice?**
A: Yes! You can add to your existing position on the same side (e.g., add more to YES if you already bet YES). You can't switch sides on the same market.

**Q: How are payouts calculated?**
A: Payouts are proportional. If the YES pool has 10 SOL and the NO pool has 5 SOL, YES bettors split the combined 15 SOL pool (minus 3% fee) proportional to their share of the YES pool.

**Q: What are Flash Markets?**
A: Quick-resolution markets that last 1 hour or 24 hours. They have a live countdown timer and are great for fast-paced betting on short-term price movements.

### Safety & Trust

**Q: Is SeekAlpha safe?**
A: The smart contract is fully open source and verifiable on GitHub. We're currently on devnet (test network) so there's zero real money at risk. Before mainnet launch, the contract will undergo additional review.

**Q: Is there a token?**
A: Not currently. We're focused on building a great product first. If/when a token launches, it will be announced through official channels only. **Do NOT trust anyone claiming to sell SeekAlpha tokens.**

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: SeekAlpha is a decentralized protocol on Solana. There's no KYC and no geo-restrictions. Users are responsible for complying with their local regulations. This is not financial advice.

### About the Project

**Q: Who built SeekAlpha?**
A: SeekAlpha was built by the Heronimo_V team — a small indie builder crew passionate about Solana and prediction markets.

**Q: What is the Solana Seeker?**
A: The Seeker is Solana's upcoming crypto-native smartphone (successor to Saga). It has its own dApp Store. SeekAlpha is being built specifically to launch on the Seeker dApp Store.

**Q: When will SeekAlpha be on mainnet?**
A: We're building and testing on devnet first to make sure everything is solid. Mainnet launch date will be announced when we're ready. Quality over speed.

**Q: What's the roadmap?**
A: 
- ✅ Phase 1: Core platform (done — live on devnet)
- ✅ Phase 2: Flash markets, gamification (done)
- 🔜 Phase 3: Social prediction leagues, community-created markets
- 🔜 Phase 4: Oracle integration, mainnet launch
- 🔜 Phase 5: Seeker dApp Store submission

**Q: How can I suggest a market?**
A: Drop your suggestion in the #market-suggestions channel on Discord! We're always looking for interesting markets to add.
